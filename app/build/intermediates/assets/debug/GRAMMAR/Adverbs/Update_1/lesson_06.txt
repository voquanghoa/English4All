I'd like to introduce you to one of my latest discoveries: 'the Forum Theatre'. I've __________________ appreciated

the theatre __________________.

In Ancient Greece, the theatre was meant to solve quarrels and misunderstandings __________________.
stupidly
terribly
slowly
 efficiently

The theatre isn't __________________ entertaining, but
 only
cleverly
very well
never

it is sometimes very educational for citizens and __________________ for society.
very well

After __________________ an­hour work, no more, a few actors play a 3­minute sketch trying to suggest conflicting solutions to a problem that was chosen.

Then, a dialogue starts __________________, at first
highly
loudly
violently
 timidly

and the 'spectators' (becoming 'spect­actors') are required to express their suggestions __________________ on the stage,
reluctantly
 freely

fiercely

__________________, interacting with the actors
wickedly
 spontaneously

forcefully

and trying to find the possible solutions __________________ .
only
 calmly
never
hurriedly

After __________________ 2 hours of discussions, questions, and performing new versions of the initial conflict,

solutions and suggestions, dictated by all, are written down __________________ on a board.

laughingly

Conversations and laughter __________________ go on long after the creation, around a few sodas! This is the Freedom of Speech!
